### 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a seasoned **Software Engineer and Architect** with over **20 years of experience**, crafting intelligent, scalable solutions across industries like banking, education, HR, forestry, and R&D. I blend a **deep understanding of systems architecture** with a strong tactical mindset for solving complex, real-world engineering challenges.

Currently, I'm focused on **AI-first engineering**, integrating tools like **Azure OpenAI**, **AI Search**, **prompt engineering**, and **LLMs** into modern applications to deliver **strategic, high-impact features**.

💡 I specialize in transforming ambiguous technical needs into clear, valuable implementations.
